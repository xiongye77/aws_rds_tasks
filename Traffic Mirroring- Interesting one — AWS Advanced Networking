Answer is at the end of the post, feel free to skip it, I just did not want to  make a spoiler residing just below the question

Traffic Mirroring is an awesome concept which can now be implemented with an AWS VPC. You can mirror the traffic and send packets to a EC2 instance or specific appliances for further processing.

Used for Content Inspection, Threat Monitoring and Troubleshooting.
An interesting as aspect is Packet-Format
*So when a packet gets mirrored it gets VXLAN encapsulated, end host/appliance should be able to decapsulate VXLAN header( we will see a PCAP ).


4 Things for Implementation
*Source (which should be monitored â€” Network Interface)

*Target (Destination of mirrored Traffic)

*Filter (What traffic types should be mirrored)

*Session( Combines all the above parameters)
